# Personal-Projects
Personal Projects I have been working on outside of school. These are for ones that are WIP, and have dedicated branches.


-Discord Py Bot:
  
    This was a discord bot that implements the Discord API as a means to practice and get a good feel for Python as a whole. I did this in collaboration with an artist 
    who runs a discord server, and needed help implementing a bot for various functions. This bot currently runs and uses commands, neat little features, information
     mining (such as user info and server info), and moderating powers. By request of the artist, this bot also implements a cache of user art submitted under the MG     tag.
   
   One key thing to note, some of the MG tag entries do contain body studies/nude sketches or suggestive art, but 
   have no explicit pornography, as per Discord TOS and personal comfort.
   
   
-DNA Sequencing:

    Basic File IO program meant to store, modify, create, and delete files or entries meant to store nucleotides within strands of DNA. Currently WIP, as 
    the original program, written in Java, was wiped by user error. More info soon.
